## Overview

**EcoBreath Purifier™** is a **portable, self-sustaining air purifier** that uses **miniature live plants, a biochar filter, and mycelium layers** to cleanse indoor air of pollutants, VOCs, and microplastics.  

Designed as a **natural, low-maintenance alternative** to electric purifiers, EcoBreath units provide **oxygen-rich, humidified air** for **homes, offices, and vehicles** — all while capturing **CO₂ and airborne toxins**.

---

## Core Features

- **Plant-Powered Purification** – Each unit contains micro-greens and moss that **actively clean the air**.  
- **Biochar + Mycelium Filter** – Captures particulates, VOCs, and CO₂ for compostable disposal.  
- **No Electricity Needed** – Passive airflow design; optional USB-powered fan for faster circulation.  
- **Compact & Modular** – Fits on a desk, car dashboard, or bedside table.  
- **Stylish, Sustainable Design** – Built from recycled materials and compostable elements.

---

## How It Works

1. **Air Intake** – Passive airflow draws room air into the unit.  
2. **Bio-Layer Filtration** – Air passes through a **moss-microgreen canopy** that absorbs CO₂ and releases oxygen.  
3. **Mycelium-Biochar Cartridge** – Traps pollutants, VOCs, and fine particulates (PM2.5, microplastics).  
4. **Clean Air Output** – Purified air is re-released, naturally humidified and oxygenated.

## Manufacturing & Scalability

- **Materials**:  
  - Recycled plastics or bamboo for casing.  
  - Biochar, mycelium, and seed substrate for cartridges.  
  - Optional low-power USB fan module.

- **Production**:  
  - Units can be **mass-produced using injection molds**.  
  - Estimated **$10–$15/unit production cost**.  
  - Retail price range: **$40–$70/unit**.

- **Scalability**:  
  - **Global retail channels**: home stores, e-commerce, and eco shops.  
  - **DAO-supported local assembly hubs** for regional markets.

---

## Use Cases

- **Home & Bedroom Air Quality** – Reduce dust, VOCs, and CO₂ indoors.  
- **Office Desks & Shared Spaces** – Boost focus and wellness.  
- **Vehicles** – Clean cabin air without disposable filters.  
- **Children’s Rooms & Schools** – Non-toxic, silent air purification.

---

## Environmental Impact

- Replaces disposable HEPA filters with **fully compostable cartridges**.  
- Each unit captures **up to 0.3 tons of CO₂ annually** (through plants and biochar).  
- **Reduces landfill waste** by avoiding synthetic filter materials.  
- Encourages **indoor greening and biophilic design**.
